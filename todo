Story:
As a world traveler I want to be able to find information for a given country.


Use case:
  - I need a list of all continents on the planet
    // List all continents with GraphQL query - done
    // Make a query component in Continents and fetch a query in it -done

  - When I selecgit t a continent I shall see all countries on that continent
     // query with GraphQL
     
  - I want to be able to search through/filter the countries list by typing a name 
      // How to make a search Filter https://dev.to/sage911/how-to-write-a-search-component-with-suggestions-in-react-d20

  - When I select a country from the list I want to see some details about it; Minimal required data is: name, currency, spoken languages; The API returns more data which can (and is recommended) to be used;

Objective:
Create a simple React application handling the use case described above

Resources:
The required data shall be acquired from this API: https://countries.trevorblades.com/
Any styling framework or other JS library found suitable can be used

Requirements:
React (obviously)
ApolloClient must be used as a GraphQL client

Notes:
- follow best practices and good coding standards; the AirBNB eslint config is a good start
- separation and understanding of functional vs design components is a plus
- PropTypes validation is a big plus
- tests are not required but a huge plus
